# Privacy Policy

YouTube Video Notes is designed with a local-first approach.

## Data We Store

- Notes you generate for videos
- Extension preferences (for example report depth and language settings)
- Your Gemini API key

All of the above is stored locally in your browser using the extension storage API.

## Data We Send

When you generate notes, the extension sends the video transcript content to the Google Gemini API so notes can be generated.

No other analytics, tracking, or telemetry data is sent by the extension.

## Data Sharing

- We do not sell data.
- We do not share your data with third parties, except the transcript content you explicitly process through Gemini to generate notes.

## Data Retention and Control

- Your notes and settings remain in local browser storage until you delete them.
- You can remove stored data at any time by clearing extension data or uninstalling the extension.
